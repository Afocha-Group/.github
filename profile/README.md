`Afocha Research`
----------------

The motive behind this research is to leverage the strengths of various technologies to create solutions that are more comprehensive and effective. Traditionally, researchers and innovators have relied on a single technology to solve a particular problem. However, this approach often limits the scope of the solution and may not provide the most efficient or effective result.

By combining different technologies, Afocha Research seeks to create a synergistic effect that enhances the strengths of each technology. For example, machine learning algorithms can be combined with natural language processing techniques to create chatbots that can understand and respond to human language in real-time. Similarly, blockchain technology can be integrated with artificial intelligence to create secure and transparent systems for data management.

### Why BOW?

developed using APL 
solution to problem focused programmung language

### Example

```bow
bow: ← ∆BOW 'loop ∞ 'event ;
 'RECAPit ← ∆[]:bow ;
:RECAPit[] ← 0…z » 6;
:RECAPit ± ∆Image 'noise +/*(68) ;
:RECAPit ± ∆Image 'jpg;
bow ⟩;
```
